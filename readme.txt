Fiscaat is accounting software, made the WordPress way

== Description ==

Have you ever been frustrated with accounting software that was slow, bloated and always got your system stuck? Fiscaat is focused on ease of integration, ease of use, web standards, and speed.

We're keeping things as small and light as possible while still allowing for great add-on features through WordPress's extensive plugin system. What does all that mean? Fiscaat is lean, mean, and ready to take on any job you throw at it.

== Installation ==

1. Place the 'fiscaat' folder in your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate Fiscaat.
3. Visit 'Settings > Fiscaat' and adjust your configuration.
4. Create some records.
5. View your financial statements.
